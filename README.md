# Github User Finder

Github User Finder is an app that uses Github Api to find users and their repos.
My aim when to build this application is to use React, Hooks and Context API


## How to Use
You need to create a .env.local file in the root folder of the app and you need to 
give parameters as;

##### Environment
* REACT_APP_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID= "github cliend id"
* REACT_APP_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="github client secret"

### Development
1. To run React client run `npm run start`

### Production
To build distribution folder, 
1. Run `npm run build` to create public folder. It will create a folder called build
